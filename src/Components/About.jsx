            <h2>What is Full Stack development ?</h2>

            <p>
                Full stack software development is the art of working on opposite ends
                of a software product. Most software applications, for example this website you are
                busy viewing, there are variuos components that make up this website.
                To keep it as brief as possible , there is the user interface which is
                what you are currently looking at on your screen. Then there is the Backend
                API (Application Programming Interface), which is like the brain of the whole
                website and connects with the third layer the database which is the "memory" of the website.

            </p>

            <p>
                So Full stack develpment covers wiorking on the frontend user interface, the backaend
                api as well as the database and a few otehrs in between!
