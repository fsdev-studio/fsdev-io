            <h2>What is Full Stack development ?</h2>

            <p>
                Full stack software development is the art of working on opposite ends
                of a software product. Most software products, for an example this web-app you are
                now viewing, various "components" make up this website.
                <br />
                To keep it brief, there is the user interface which is
                what you are currently looking at on your screen.
                <br />
                Then there is the Backend API (Application Programming Interface), and is like the "brain of the whole
                operation" and connects with the third layer which is the database and can be thought of as the "long term memory" of the website.

            </p>

            <p>
                So in short full stack develpment covers working on the frontend user interface, the backend api
                as well as the database and a few others in between!
            </p>

            <p>
                Building a software product can become a tedious and timely endevour and with
                software changing at a rapid pace, you need a resource that you can use to help
                you along your way of taking an idea to reality. That's what we would like to be for you!
